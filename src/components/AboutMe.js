                    <em>
                    I am a 21 year old full-stack software developer from Pennsylvannia experienced in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, react, ruby, and rails. I have a background in customer service and management, which helped develop my leadership, teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and time-management skills. Throughout my time in flatirons program, I not only developed technical skills but also a sense of drive, and the ability to learn challenging concepts quickly and efficiently. I'm excited to continually grow and hone these skills while also developing new ones throughout my engineering journey.
